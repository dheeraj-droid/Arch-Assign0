# Arch Assign0
This is a implementation of  a infiltrator trying to cross from attacking country to defending country where the border between the countries contains motion sensors which detects if he moved or not.
He will always cross the border and time to cross the border will be the output.
To run the program first run javac Project.java in the IDE's Terminal
Then open plot.py and click run then you will get the plot.
Project1.java is a model of this which just uses a constant inputs and outputs the crossing time.
