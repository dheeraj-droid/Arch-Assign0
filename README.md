This is a implementation of  a infiltrator trying to cross from attacking country to defending country where the border between the countries contains motion sensors which detects if he moved or not.
He will always cross the border and time to cross the border will be the output.
To run the program first open the folder in the terminal.
Then compile the java programs using Javac Project.java
Then click python plots.py or python3 plots.py and then wait until the graph is displayed.
Project1.java is a model of this which just uses a constant inputs and outputs the crossing time.
